# Why?
To stop your private secret key being pushed to Git.

**IMPORTANT: PLEASE REMOVE YOUR API KEY WHEN SHARING CODE PUBLICALLY**

If you ever upload your code to a public GitHub repo to share with others, itâ€™s illegal to include your personal secret API key. 
Please remove it and note in a README where it came from, so someone else trying to run your code can create their own key and will 
quickly know where to put it.
